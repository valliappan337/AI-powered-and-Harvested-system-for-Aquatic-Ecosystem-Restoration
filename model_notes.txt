Model Weights Description (English)

This folder contains trained YOLOv8 model weights for drone detection tasks using different data modalities.

1. weights(S300)/:
   - Type: Visible + Infrared (RGBT) fusion dataset
   - Dataset: Anti-UAV (subset S300)
   - Model: YOLOv8
   - Output: Best checkpoint saved based on validation performance
   - Purpose: Used for detecting drones in mixed-sensor video streams

2. weights(S410)/:
   - Type: Infrared-only dataset
   - Dataset: Anti-UAV (subset S410)
   - Model: YOLOv8
   - Output: Best checkpoint based on infrared input
   - Purpose: Used for drone detection under low-light or thermal imaging conditions

Note: All models are trained with a confidence threshold of 0.2 and use mAP@0.5 as the primary evaluation metric.
